Abstract
========
Collective Emission Studies Using Green Function Method.

Quantum Optics is a field where quantum theory and optics merge together. This presentation will introduce the Green function method in the scenario of cavity-QED to demonstrate the link bridging quantum and optics to study the quantum nature of ensemble emissions. Applications will be illustrated as my master's thesis studies on collective photon emissions of an exciton ensemble in an optical cavity. Pumping dynamics and collective modification effects (superradiance and subradiance) on the cavity's spectrum will be presented. Some possible research topics using the Green function method on quantum control and measurement of atoms in nanophotonic structures will be discussed at last.
